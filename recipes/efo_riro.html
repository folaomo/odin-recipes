   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>The African Stewed Spinach also popularly known as Efo
     riro is a one-pot stew with layers of flavor. It requires quite
      a number of ingredients but little work from the cook putting it 
      all together (as long as you already have all your ingredients prepped).
    </p>

    <p>
    Efo riro is derived from the Yoruba language in Nigeria. Efo means ”Green
     leafy vegetable” or ”spinach”, and riro, means ”to stir”.  So basically, 
     Efo riro simply means ”stirred leafy vegetable”. However, we just don’t stir 
     this by itself, we stir it in a rich pepper sauce which is loaded with Meat, 
     Crayfish, Dry Fish, and other Meat or Fish of Choice.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large red bell peppers</li>
        <li>2 scotch bonnet</li>
        <li>1  small onion</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Palm oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons crayfish blended</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon locust bean</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>1.5 lb spinach blanched</li>
        <li>1/2 cup stock Fish About 2 handfuls shredded</li>
        <li>1 prawn about a handful, Dried</li>
        <li>1 lb Beef A mixture of Beef, Tripe, and cow Skin.</li>
        <li>1 prawn about a handful, Dried</li>   
        <li>1 onion medium size diced</li> 
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Blend the bell peppers, scotch bonnet, and onion</li>
        <li>Preheat the palm oil - I like it hot but not bleached. Add the diced onion and stir-fry till golden brown. Add the blended peppers and fry until the sauce thickens up. It takes about 15 minutes, and you need to stir constantly to prevent burning.</li>
        <li>Stir in the crayfish, locust bean, bouillon cube, and salt to taste. Stir until everything is well blended.</li>
        <li>Add the meat, stockfish, and dried prawns and add some water or stock to thin out the sauce, then cover it up again and allow it to come to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Finally, add the spinach and mix well. Then leave it to cook uncovered for about 2 to 5 minutes. Adjust the seasoning if necessary.</li>
    </ol>
