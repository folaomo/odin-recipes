     meat cutlets or chunks, pepper soup spice, and other beautiful
      condiments.  If you are looking for an authentic Goat meat 
      pepper soup, this soup certainly delivers the big, bold African

    </p>

    <p>
        The African Pepper soup is primarily liquid, usually served
         hot and this is made by boiling Meat or Fish of choice in 
         order to extract flavor from them. The broth from this Meat
          is then further seasoned with authentic African spices. 
          It can be served with boiled Potatoes, Rice, Bread or 
          just eat ”as is”.
