# odin-recipes
A new odin project
In this project, I will be using HTML to create a recipe website using a few html elements and tags.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

 I will be creating a new repository on GitHub names "odin-recipes" and downloading it into my local machine using "git clone git@github.com:folaomo/odin-recipes.git" command. 
 
 I will create the html file in the repository downloaded in my local amchine using the "touch index.html" command, check status and commit my code.
